Develop an educational platform where students can complete exercises online. The system should allow students to submit responses, which are then processed and evaluated using an AI-based machine evaluator. The platform will store all interactions in a database, including student inputs and AI-generated outputs. The system should present the evaluated response back to the student for immediate feedback. This project aims to enhance learning experiences by integrating AI evaluation tools for educational exercises.
